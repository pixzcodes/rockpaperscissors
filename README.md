A simple game of Rock, Paper, Scissors
I will be making a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game in javascript.
I plan to add a gui to it later on but for now it will just be played through the console.

## UPDATE
I have added a gui to the game including buttons and text to keep track of things like choices and score
